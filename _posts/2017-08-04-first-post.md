This is a start.<br><br>
Maybe this blog will trick my mind and help me organize myself and keep me away of distractions from... things.
<br><br>So, this game is about heroes, shitty heroes mostly. I want them to feel real, I want them to die, and I want the 
player to like the gameplay. There is a problem here though: It's my first game, it's my first world building, 
it's my first storytelling thing. So, how do you make a videogame setting real, let's say by avoiding mary sue cliches,
and keep the player happy and also bonded with the heroes? Maybe I can't. I have no idea what I'm talking
about, I'll try though. 
<br><br>In patrician, when there was a battle, you could lose your ship either by being destroyed or by being taken from you.
I think in the hero battles, heroes might die or they could change side and become villains. No idea yet about
the gameplay of the battle. Turn based, real time, everything is on right now.<br>
<br>In the graphics part, I'm really bad and don't want to think about it, so next question.<br>
<br>In the music part, let's hope my music studies background will help, and I think it will when the time comes. But
there are most important things before that.<br>
<br>Now I have to implement most of the basic things that are on the TODO page, and then start thinking about the battle
and quest system. Also, I don't really like the current algorithm for the trades, and my math skills suck, so I have to
do something about that too. Maybe when I have a basic gameplay, I'll build some versions of the game for sharing.
<br> <br>That's all for a first post. Quite ambitious I think, and will haunt me every time I read it and I am not working. Well,
 it's too easy to delete it.
