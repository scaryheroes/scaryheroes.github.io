This is a dev blog for my hero management game Scary Heroes and Super Losers(temporary title), inspired by the patrician games.
I will be using the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">Godot</a> 3 alpha, <a
href="https://github.com/KDE/krita">Krita</a>, and other free software in my shitty linux laptop.
